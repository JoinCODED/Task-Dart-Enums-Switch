# Switch and Enums: Calculator 🔀

Create an `enum` called `Operation` with following values:

```
plus
minus
multiply
divide
```

And create 2 integers called `num1` and `num2`, and a variable called `op` thats stores one of the `enum`s.

Then create a `switch` statement and based on the value of `op` print the sum, sub, multiple or division of the `num1` and `num2`.

Example:
if `op` is equal to `Operation.plus` then print `num1` + `num2`.
